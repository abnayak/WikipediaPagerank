'''''...Baby One More Time''''' is the debut [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Britney Spears]]. It was released on January 12, 1999, by [[Jive Records]]. In June 1997, while Spears negotiated with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group [[Innosense]], her mother asked family friend and entertainment lawyer [[Larry Rudolph]] for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a [[Whitney Houston]] [[karaoke]] song. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, sending them a demo tape with an unused song from [[Toni Braxton]]. Jive was interested and appointed the singer to work with producer Eric Foster White. After hearing the recorded material, Jive signed Spears to a multi-album deal.

Spears traveled to Sweden to work with producers [[Max Martin]], [[Denniz Pop]] and [[Rami Yacoub]], among others. Martin showed Spears and her management a track titled &quot;Hit Me Baby One More Time&quot;, which was originally written for American R&amp;B group [[TLC (band)|TLC]]; however, they rejected the track. Spears later claimed that she felt excited when she heard it and knew it was going to be a hit record. By June 1998, the album had been finished.

Critics gave the album mixed reviews, describing the singer as a [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] next door, considering it silly and premature. The album was successful on the charts, reaching the top five in several countries, while reaching number one in Canada and the United States. It also received several certifications around the world, including a [[RIAA certification|fourteen-times platinum]] certification by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA), for shipments of over 14 million units in the country. ''...Baby One More Time'' is Spears' most successful album, selling over 30 million copies worldwide, making it one of the [[List of best-selling albums|best-selling albums of all time]] and the best-selling album by a teenage solo artist.

Five singles came from the album. &quot;[[...Baby One More Time]]&quot; became a worldwide success and one of the [[List of best-selling singles worldwide|best-selling singles of all time]], at over ten million copies. The album was promoted with appearances on live television, and also by the [[...Baby One More Time Tour]] in 1999, with a second leg titled [[...Baby One More Time Tour|Crazy 2k Tour]] in 2000. Spears claimed she wasn't able to explore her vocal ability on the album. This album set Spears' international [[Pop icon|pop culture icon]] image and launched her career. The album earned Spears [[Grammy]] nominations for [[Best New Artist]] and [[Best Female Pop Vocal Performance]] for &quot;...Baby One More Time.&quot;

==Background and development==
{{Quote box|width=30%|align=left|quote=&quot;I had been in studio for about six months listening and recording material, but I hadn't really heard a hit yet. When I started working with Max Martin in Sweden, he played the demo for 'Baby One More Time' for me, and I knew from the start it one was of those songs you want to hear again and again. It just felt really right. I went into the studio and did my own thing with it, trying to give it a little more attitude than the demo. In 10 days, I never even saw Sweden. We were so busy.&quot;|source=—Spears talking to Chuck Taylor of ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= |year=1998 |title=Jive's Britney Spears Sets Top 40 Abuzz With Rhythm-Leaning 'Baby One More Time' |journal=Billboard |volume=110 |issue=43 |page=104 |publisher=Prometheus Global Media |issn=0006-2510 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=JQoEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA80&amp;dq=%22...baby+one+more+time%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22...baby%20one%20more%20time%22&amp;f=false |accessdate= September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager [[Lou Pearlman]] to join female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided to pitch her to record labels, which required a professional [[demo (music)|demo]]. He sent Spears an unused song from Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded in a studio with a [[Audio engineering|sound engineer]]. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three rejected her, arguing audiences wanted pop bands such as the [[Backstreet Boys]] and the [[Spice Girls]], and &quot;there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another [[Debbie Gibson]] or another [[Tiffany (American singer)|Tiffany]].&quot; Two weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.&lt;ref name=&quot;hughes145&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Senior vice president of [[Artists and repertoire|A&amp;R]] Jeff Fenster stated, &quot;It's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal. [...] For any artist, the motivation—the 'eye of the tiger'— is extremely important. And Britney had that.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|url=|title=Cover Story: Britney Spears: Britney Spears : Rolling Stone|date=April 15, 1999|work=Rolling Stone|publisher=[[Jann Wenner]]|last=Daly|first=Steven|issn=0035-791X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They appointed her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month, who reportedly shaped her voice from &quot;lower and less poppy&quot; delivery to &quot;distinctively, unmistakably Britney.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hughes 2005 147&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Hughes|2005|p=147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spears recorded ten songs with White, including &quot;Autumn Goodbye&quot;, &quot;E-Mail My Heart&quot;, &quot;From the Bottom of My Broken Heart&quot;, &quot;I'm So Curious&quot;, &quot;I Will Still Love You&quot;, &quot;Soda Pop&quot;, and &quot;Thinkin' About You&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;liner&quot;&gt;''...Baby One More Time'' liner notes.

==Composition==

Spears had originally envisioned &quot;[[Sheryl Crow]] music, but younger more adult contemporary&quot;, but felt all right with her label's producers, since &quot;It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it—it's more me.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rs1&quot; /&gt; The album opens with the first single &quot;[[...Baby One More Time]]&quot;, a [[teen pop]] and [[dance-pop]] song that begins with a three-note [[motif (music)|motif]] in the bass range of the [[piano]]. The opening was compared to many other songs, such as &quot;[[We Will Rock You]]&quot; (1977), &quot;[[Start Me Up]]&quot; (1981) and the theme song of the film ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'' due to the fact the track &quot;makes its presence known in exactly one second&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;blender&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicnotes.com/sheetmusic/mtdVPE.asp?ppn=MN0027207|title=Britney Spears Baby One More Time - Sheet Music|work=Music Notes|publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|accessdate=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allmusic.com/album/baby-one-more-time-us-cd-single-r377377|title=...Baby One More Time (US CD Single) - Britney Spears|publisher=[[Allmusic]].

Kyle Anderson of [[MTV]] said he &quot;was surprised in more ways than one &quot;with his first listening of ''...Baby One More Time'', commenting he &quot;expected there to be a lot of filler (there sort of is), though I didn't expect it to be as odd (at least sonically) as it ended up being.

Spears was credited with leading the revival of [[teen pop]].
